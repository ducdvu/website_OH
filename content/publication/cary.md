abstract = "Understanding the carbon cycle and developing the ability to predict future carbon balances has emerged as one of the premier scientific challenges of our time. Lakes and other freshwater systems are hotspots for carbon transformation on the landscape, and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle.  Despite the importance of the freshwater systems in regional and global carbon budgets, there are few models that describe the aquatic carbon dynamics and forecast its responses to the changing environment.  In this study we developed a suite of models that assumed various mechanisms of carbon dynamics and evaluated their performance on the observed time series of dissolved organic carbon and COâ‚‚, collected from a small lake in northern Michigan, USA. To ensure the best possible performance of a given model structure we calibrated it against the observations using Bayesian inversion. Such approach allowed us to gain insight into the processes that regulate in situ carbon dynamics in a lake."
