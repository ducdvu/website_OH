# Biography

I am a research scientist focusing on ecological modelling and model-data fusion. 
Mathematical models are a useful tool for evaluating ecosystems' responses to changes in environment and are indispensable for making ecological forecasts and developing strategies for ecosystem management. In my work I explore how ecosystems respond to the changing drivers (such as atmospheric COâ‚‚, temperature, and moisture regime), translate this knowledge into mathematical models, and ensure their reliability through data-model fusion.
