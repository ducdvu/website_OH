# Research

My research focuses on ecoinformatics, ecological modelling, and model-data fusion. Over the past decades ecology has been transitioning from a data-poor into a data-rich field, and much knowledge can be gained through synthesizing and analyzing observations from multiple data streams. Mathematical models are a useful tool for learning about ecosystems as well as evaluating their response to changes in the environment. Models are also indispensable for making ecological forecasts and developing strategies for ecosystem management. In my work I explore how ecosystems respond to the changing drivers (such as elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, altered temperature, and moisture regime), translate this knowledge into mathematical models, and ensure their reliability through data-model fusion.
